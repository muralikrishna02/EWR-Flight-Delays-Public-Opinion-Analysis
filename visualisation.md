The delay at EWR in the year 2022 can be attributed to various factors, such as the weather at the airport and capacity. Therefore, we have analyzed the data containing weather, capacity, and delay at EWR airport from 2018 to 2022 to determine the reason for the increased delays in 2022.

Figure 2. Arrivals per year

	Arrivals and departures have been almost constant in the year 2018 and 2019. Later in the year, we can see that arrivals and departures have decreased to a great extent. This decrease can be attributed to the Covid-19 outbreak. Later in 2021 and 2022, we see that travel has started booming and returning to normal. However, the arrivals and departures are still less in 2022 compared to 2018 and 2019. The delays at EWR pre-Covid were high, and traffic was at an all-time high. Although it declined due to travel restrictions during the Covid period and post-Covid due to ease in travel restrictions, traffic is on a continuous rise which will raise problems related to airport capacity, arrivals, and departures, increasing in turn delays. Another factor for an increase in delays in 2022 may be attributed to the reduction in the airport staff post-Covid.
 

Figure 3. Delays at EWR in the year 2022


	Different types of delays at EWR airport in 2022 are plotted as a pie chart in Figure 3. Again, average airport departure delay constitutes a significant part of delays with 29.7%.

Figure 6. Average Taxi-In Delays at EWR per year
	Figure 4 shows various delays that occurred at EWR airport from the year 2018 to 2022. All the delays except the taxi-in delay have happened in the same proportions each year. Even though the number of arrivals and departures in 2022 is less than in 2018, the taxi-in delay has increased from 18% in 2018 to 30.4% in 2022, as seen in Figure 6. Taxi-In delays might be one of the reasons for increased overall delays at EWR airport in 2022.


 
Figure 7. ADR + Capacity AAR and VMC Weather per year


 
Figure 8. ADR and Efficiency AAR per year


	The arrivals and departures handling capacity of EWR decreased over the years, as seen in Figure 7. In contrast, the number of hours with Visual Meteorological Conditions(VMC) has increased from 2018 to 2022. So, in our analysis, we found that weather is not the primary factor behind the increase in delays in the year 2022.

 
Figure 9. ADR and Efficiency AAR per year


 
Figure 10. Efficiency AAR and Capacity AAR per year


Figure 9 shows that Airport Departure Rates and Efficiency Airport Arrival Rates are less in 2022 than in 2018. Therefore, it can be inferred that the arrivals and departures handling capacity of EWR airport have been reduced to a great extent. This might be one of the reasons for increased delays in 2022. Also, EWR airport has been working at Efficiency Airport Arrival Rates rather than Capacity Airport Arrival Rates over all the years. This might be due to traffic management initiatives in place. This shows that EWR airport is working at less capacity, which might be one of the reasons for the increase in delays at EWR in 2022.

Figure 12. Departure Efficiency of EWR utilized per year


 
Figure 11. SAER of EWR per year
An airportâ€™s percentage capacity is defined as the capacity it has used out of its actual capacity. System Airport Efficiency Rate (SAER) measures the extent to which an airport handled the number of aircraft it indicated it could accommodate and how well the demand was met. From the above line graphs, the percentage utilized capacity of EWR airport and System Airport Efficiency Rate (SAER) is reduced in the year 2022 compared to the years 2018 and 2019. Hence, capacity is the primary reason behind the increase in delays at EWR in 2022.
